# Calculator-Project
A calculator project in Python involves creating a program that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project can range from a simple command-line interface to a more complex graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter.

Key Components

1.Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Implement functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2.User Input:
Use the input function to get numbers and the operation from the user.

3.Control Flow:
Use conditionals to determine which operation to perform based on user input.

4.Error Handling:
Handle potential errors such as division by zero and invalid input.
